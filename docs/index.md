## Bio

I am a final-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), also currently a research intern at [Horizon Robotics](https://horizon.ai/). I was advised by [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/zhouhan-lin.html) at SJTU and [Yichen Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3bTLycAAAAJ&hl=en) at Horizon Robotics. My research interest covers Multimodal Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation, Speech Recognition and Self-Supervised Learning. I will join [Cheriton R. Computer Science School at University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) in Fall 2022, advised by [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/).
