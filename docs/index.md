## Bio

I am currently a Research Assistant at Microsoft Research Asia, mentored by [Dr. Li Dong](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wEfQgPgAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interest lies in multimodal learning with a focus on vision, language, and audio modalities. I am especially interested in multimodal representation learning and multimodal self-supervised pre-training. Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and won the Best Thesis Award. I was fortunately advised by and maintain a close connection with [Prof. Zhouhan Lin](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/zhouhan-lin.html) at SJTU.
